Introduction
==========================================

The Exabel Graph API is used to maintain and upload custom data to Exabel's Intelligent Modelling platform.

The main data elements are *entities* that represent some real world entities and *time series* connected to those
entities as *signals*. Entities may be interconnected in a *graph* with *relationships*.

Exabel maintains several sets of entities that can be used directly or connected to your own graph, for example:

* Companies
* Securities
* Listings
* Countries

Custom entities must be of an *entity type* from Exabel's type catalogue. If you need new types to be added to the
catalogue, contact support@exabel.com.

*TODO: Insert sample graph drawing here*
