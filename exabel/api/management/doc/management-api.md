The Exabel Management API can be used to manage the library on the Exabel Platform, including sharing. 

To access the Management API, you need an API key provided by Exabel.

You can access the Management API either directly by using gRPC or REST, or by using the [Exabel Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/exabel-data-sdk/)

The Management API service definitions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Exabel/api/tree/master/exabel/api/management/v1).
