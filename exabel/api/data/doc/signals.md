A _signal_ is a type of time series, such as _price_ or _revenue_. A signal is used to create a time series for that signal connected to an entity.

There are no signals in the global namespace. Customers can create signals in their own namespace.

The purpose of signals is to identify kinds of time series. When you have created a signal, you can upload one time series for that signal for any entity.

The collection id for signals is `signals`.
