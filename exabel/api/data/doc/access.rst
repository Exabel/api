Accessing the API
=================

To access the Data API, you need an API key provided by Exabel.

You can access the Data API either directly by using gRPC or REST or by using the Exabel
Python SDK: https://pypi.org/project/exabel-data-sdk/

The Data API service definitions can be found here: https://github.com/Exabel/api/tree/master/exabel/api/data/v1

API developer reference documentation can be found here:
https://apidocs.exabel.com/docs/data.api.exabel.com/g/introduction
(requires a Google account registered with Exabel to be able to access)

See the following sections for more details about the different data types and how to work with them
using REST:
