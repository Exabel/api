The Exabel Analytics API can be used to manage derived signals and prediction models on the Exabel Platform. 

To access the Analytics API, you need an API key provided by Exabel.

You can access the Analytics API either directly by using gRPC or REST, or by using the [Exabel Python SDK](https://pypi.org/project/exabel-data-sdk/)

The Analytics API service definitions can be found on [GitHub](https://github.com/Exabel/api/tree/master/exabel/api/analytics/v1).
